# NASM ports of exercises from Bartlett's Programming from the Ground Up

Jonathan Bartlett's 2003 book _Programming from the Ground Up_ is an
excellent primer for 32-bit (i386) architecture assembly (and
fundamental programming in general. I've got a paper copy, but you can
also read it for free (and download from) archive.org:

https://archive.org/details/programming-from-the-ground-up

This repo contains my NASM translations of the programs. The `go.sh`
shell script assembles, links, and runs them (leave off the extension):

    $ ./go.sh ch03.1_exit
    Exited with code: 0

Status: I've just started this repo and need to catch up to where I am
in the book.
