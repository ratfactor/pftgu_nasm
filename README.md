# NASM ports of exercises from Programming from the Ground Up

The 2003 book _Programming from the Ground Up_ is an excellent primer
for 32-bit (i386) architecture assembly (and fundamental programming in
general). I've got a paper copy, but you can also read it for free
at archive.org:

https://archive.org/details/programming-from-the-ground-up

This repo contains my NASM translations of the programs. The `go.sh`
shell script assembles, links, and runs them (leave off the extension):

    $ ./go.sh ch03.1_exit
    Exited with code: 0

Status: I've just started this repo and need to catch up to where I am
in the book.

Personal note: I like this book a lot, but I do not endorse the author
or his views outside of this one single subject.
